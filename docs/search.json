    "text": "image by Norbert Kowalczyk from Unsplash\n\n1.\n\nWhat are humanity’s great dreams? To conquer the world? To split the atom? When Alexander spread his empire from the Mediterranean to India, we say he conquered the world, but he barely touched a quarter of it. We lie. We lie again when we say we split the atom. ‘Atom’ was supposed to be the smallest piece of matter—all we did is give that name to something we can split, knowing that there are quarks and tensors, other pieces smaller that we cannot touch, and only these deserve the title ‘atom.’ Man is more ambitious than patient. When we realize we cannot split a true atom, cannot conquer the whole Earth, we redefine the terms to fake our victory, check off our boxes and pretend the deed is done. Alexander conquered Earth, we tell ourselves, Rutherford split the atom, no need to try again. Lies.\n\n– Ada Palmer, Too Like the Lightning\n\n\n2.\nMogadishu, the now-capital of Somalia, is a port city on the Indian Ocean. It has been a trade hub for Centuries. When Marco Polo explored the Indian Ocean, it was one of the cities he looked for. He thought he found it, too, and wrote on his map, ‘Madageiscar’ (by way of transliteration). He was wrong and influential and the name spread. Soon, the name ‘Madageiscar’ appeared on maps everywhere atop the island now known as Madagascar.\n\n\n3.\nIt should come as no surprise that humans can split a chair. All we need do is bring a sufficiently large hammer, and we will find the chair in pieces. To split those pieces, we might bring a sharp saw, and to split those pieces, we can use a knife. To split salt, we can dissolve it in water. To split a metal, we can melt it.\nBut each time we split something, we find smaller things. Either, this continues forever, and we find infinitely divisible pieces to our world, or there must be some smallest things – these ‘atoms’ we cannot split. To the Greeks, the former was preposterous and the latter was a matter of course.\nMuch, much later, we found things that we could not split. Sure, we could dissolve salt, but then what about the sodium? We could melt metal, but could not divide the iron. ‘We have found the atom!’ We rejoiced.\nThen, we found the subatomic particles. (We should never have found subatomic particles.) We found the quarks and the tensors and the strange wave-particle duals of quantum physics, and now we write electrons as probability distributions and must ask: ‘Was there ever an atom?’. Perhaps the Greeks were right and infinite divisibility is unthinkable, but perhaps they were wrong too. Perhaps there is a third answer.\n\n\n4.\n‘Homer did not exist’.\nWhat does it mean to say that? Homer is the man who penned the Iliad and the Odyssey. Perhaps the man who penned the Iliad is not also the man who penned the Odyssey. Perhaps a woman first penned both. Perhaps no one person penned either, and they were both assembled by committee.\n\n\n5.\nThat island is Madagascar. The people who live there say so; the United Nations says so; even the Oxford English Dictionary says so. I would be thoroughly outvoted were I to say otherwise.\nAnd yet… ‘Madagascar’ is ‘Mogadishu’ as surely as ‘Anne’ is ‘Anna’. And ‘Mogadishu’ is ancient. So ancient that we do not know where the name comes from (but my favourite theory is that the name means ‘sight killer’). If I, in London, were to start calling the city ‘Bombay’, might we someday have a Bombay in England?\n\n\n6.\nIs that island Madagascar? And if so, is not an atom an atom?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "image from celestegame.com\nCeleste is a video game about achievement, depression, and intrapersonal conflict. In the game, you – Madeleine – climb Mount Celeste. Over the course of seven chapters, you face the challenges presented by yourself and by the mountain, and finally emerge victorious. It’s a beautiful story, deeply emotional and yet, at its core, perfectly simplistic. What sets this story apart, is the way Celeste tells you this story: you are Madeleine, and Madeleine is you.\nI can point to the exact moment I realised I wanted to write about Celeste. There are only really five characters in the entire game: Madeleine; an old woman who lives on the mountain; Mr. Oshiro, the lost spirit of a hotel clerk; Theo, a fellow climber; and a part of Madeleine made physical by Mount Celeste itself (Shadow-Madeleine, if you will). Shadow-Madeleine, the final and perhaps most interesting character, haunts Madeleine. She is, it seems, what Madeleine was running away from when she came to Mount Celeste. When Shadow-Madeleine is first introduced, she chases you across to the end of the level. Indeed, she haunts you in the levels to come. But at the end of the story’s darkest night, that changes – Madeleine decides to stop running away from the negative, goth-girl part of her, and embraces her instead.\nThis moment happens in cutscene. And from the cutscene alone, the moment is powerful, but it is nowhere near as powerful as what follows. After the cutscene, you – as Madeleine – now have to chase Shadow-Madeleine. As you chase her, she pushes you away and throws projectiles your way. The challenge of the game is inverted: you go from trying to avoid Shadow-Madeleine to chasing her. By inverting the level design like this, the game turns its core mechanic (platforming) into a storytelling tool. You, the player, feel Madeleine’s fear of self while running. Then, later, her desperate scramble to catch and accept that part of her is mirrored in your own struggle. What’s more, when you finally do catch Shadow-Madeleine, uniting the two, you are rewarded with an extra ability – your initial one dash is now two dashes. In the most intuitive way possible, the game makes Madeleine twice as powerful, and as soon as you get this power, you move to challenges that would have been impossible without it.\nThis is far from the only time the game’s mechanics tell a story. Madeleine’s anxiety, too, is made tactile. When she has a panic attack, Theo tells her to, ‘focus on your breathing’, while you, the player, are given a mini-game in which you breathe. The mini-game gives you no warning and no tutorial, and learning how to play it on the fly is genuinely panic-inducing. When you do master the new mechanic, Madeleine regains her inner calm. The graphics, music, and movement all reflect that.\nThroughout, the game goes to extraordinary lengths to place the player in Madeleine’s position, and these lengths pay off. I should mention here that Celeste is an exceptionally difficult game – and it’s intended to be. Climbing a mountain is difficult. The developers developed an assist mode – an important decision that makes the game accessible – but they placed a disclaimer on this mode: the game is designed to challenge. This difficulty is part of the fun of the game, but it is also narratively useful. Reaching the top is only so rewarding because the climb was hard."

    "text": "image taken from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_yellow\nOnly the insane go outside these days. There are few things worse than the toxic air of the moon, but admittedly, this comes close.\nI haven’t left this room in a week. Carter comes in and out, and he tells me that some day soon he’ll be able to smuggle me out to the belt, but until he does, I’m the world’s most wanted fugitive. It’s funny – in the movies, being a fugitive is always so exciting: exciting chases, thrilling games of cat-and-mouse. Hell, even when they’re hiding, it’s interesting. At this point, I’m not even scared I’ll be caught. I’m just bored.\nMy new world is a run-down storage closet on the sixty-fifth floor of the excavationary. The gravity’s alright, the air’s a bit stuffy, and it’s actually a decent size. It’s got those old flourescent lights – you know, the ones that flicker? I’ve no idea why anyone ever built anything with those, and can’t imagine how it ended up on the moon, but I guess those lights are here to stay. The worst part of my room is the puke-yellow wallpaper. It’s nauseating and captivating and I spend all my time staring at it because I have nothing to do.\nYou know, I almost miss the fear. At least that was something. Come to think of it, shouldn’t I be hysterical? I haven’t seen the sun in who knows how long, and my only human interaction is with Carter. Carter could bore a brick. This wall is a better conversationalist.\nSo I just stare at my wall.\nYou know, it’s actually not so bad. I noticed a few days ago that the wallpaper has subtle swirls in it. It’s yellow-on-yellow, but there’s a slightly raised pattern of clockwise swirls.\nI noticed today that there’s actually two shades of yellow in the wallpaper. There’s a counterclockwise motion in colour grades that forms a nice counterpoint to the swirls.\nYou know what? It’s actually not so bad. Maybe I’ll stare at the wallpaper a bit longer."

    "section": "",
    "text": "image from Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse; taken from IMDB\nThis is a spoiler warning for Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse. If you haven’t seen it already, go see it.\n\n1.\nPeople (read: nerds) spend a lot of time arguing about whose Spider-man is the best. Up until this year, I’d have said any of the answers seemed alright to me. Into the Spiderverse was obviously masterful, but it was a one-off. The Tom Holland films, at least, are consistent. I’m too young to say I liked Andrew Garfield or Toby Mcguire best, but I used to get it when other people did.\nNo more. As of a few days ago, there is only one right answer to this.\n(It’s the animated films. The animated films are the best.)\n\n\n2.\nIn 2018, Into the Spiderverse’s comic-inspired, over-the-top, anti-realist animation was a trendsetter. Disney was – and still is – on a hyper-realism kick. Every comparable modern superhero movie remained chained to the shackles of live-action. And the Spiderverse animators had clearly decided to take a risk; to dip their toes in the ponds of their own style.\nWhere Into the Spiderverse dipped it’s toes, Across the Spiderverse dives in headfirst. Comic panels shoot from a cute gimmick to a central part of the story’s medium. Each spiderman still has their own art style, but now each spiderverse has a style to mimic it; the entire intro sequence takes place in Gwen’s neon pink and green universe (while she deals with her problems, the colours change to reflect her mood), then a vulture from another dimension shows up and he’s this monochrome aberration staining her world of colour.\n\n\n3.\nI want to say I have no notes. But that’s not true. I’m me; of course I have notes. The inside jokes and fan service were both a bit much, some of the cameos were sloppy, the world’s internal logic falls apart under a strong breeze (that’s not a criticism, it’s true of all multiverse movies), and sort-of pseudo love triangle was so poorly executed.\nI get what they were going for. I really do. Miles has been trapped in his own dimension this whole time. It isn’t a stretch to say they would have drifted apart. It’s not surprising that Gwen, a drummer, would hit it off with spiderpunk. This also works for the characters of both Miles and Gwen. Miles is dealing with a multiverse that has moved on without him, and how better to demonstrate that then to have Gwen move on? Gwen has been looking for belonging this whole time, and though she thought she might have found that in Miles, she can’t go see Miles. So instead she turns to spiderpunk. (There’s textual evidence for this – she stopped carrying that picture of her and Miles at the same time she joined the multiverse.)\nMy real issue with the love triangle is how quickly it was dropped. A series of quips are made of it in the early stages of the film, but once spiderpunk (Hobie Brown) is actually introduced, we see none of the tension implied earlier. Miles goes from inferiority complex to mentee in two scenes, and the aforementioned drama is never brought up again.\n\n\n4.\nIf you’ve seen the film, you might rebut my last point with the following: “It’s only the second movie; the third might resolve this tension”. Indeed, there’s no way around it: the film doesn’t have an ending. I’ve heard the working titles mostly included “Part 1”, which would have made it better, but the final title does not have those two magic words. Instead, it is merely an unfinished sequel and the second part of a three-part series.\nOnly liars will tell you this does not diminish the film. And, while I would most certainly rather have half of an excellent film than all of a mediocre one, releasing a film like Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse would be a lot like ending a review on a…"

    "title": "Pai: A Travelogue",
    "section": "",
    "text": "image from Polina Kocheva on Unsplash\nA friend of a friend said of Pai: “If you haven’t been to Pai, you haven’t been to Thailand”, and I can hardly think of a description less apt.\nThe small mountain town in North Thailand is inaccessible by any account. An extensive series of flights to Chiangmai and a nauseating three hour drive saw us to our boutique Pai hostel, where we began our trip to Thailand with a nap. Shortly thereafter, though, at a healthy 3pm, we found our way into the town.\nPai’s town square boasts four – maybe five – streets in total. As I made my way to a local cafe for something to drink, I saw them largely empty. There was a spattering of motorcycles (“motos”) and even a few cars, but there were few people out and about. When I left to go about my evening, the entire area had turned into a pedestrian-only (with the exception of the occasional moto) night market.\nStalls of local foods and wares lined every street. Everything from fresh coconuts to pad Thai was on offer. locals and tourists alike haggled all across the town. But as the night dragged on, I couldn’t help but feel more and more uncomfortable. While locals would occasionally speak Thai to each other, English touched my ears more often. That is not to say I didn’t enjoy the night market. I had the best Thai food I’ve ever had at อร่อยติดล้อ ปาย (whose less poetic English name is: Food Truck Thai Food at Pai Street Walking Street), and for that alone I must recommend you go.\nStill, while there was a diversity of a sort to the crowd on the street, I began to see a fissure between the predominantly wealthy white tourists and the lower-middle income people of Pai. The predominantly wealthy white tourists of Pai never engaged the locals beyond the requisite monetary transactions (“How much is this?” and “Thank you for the food.”), they all seemed to know each other, and, perhaps most telling, I never saw a single local buy anything. Pai it seems, has a tourist class. And, knowing what I know now, when the tourist class says: “If you haven’t been to Pai, you haven’t been to Thailand” I can’t bring myself to believe them.\n\nMy discomfort did not fade after that first night. Still, the next day, I found myself enjoying Pai more than I had expected to. We spent most of the day outside the town. We first visited the Yun Lai viewpoint, where the hillscape greeted us in all its majesty. We continued on to the Mor Paeng waterfall, where I climbed up then slid down a rock wall and natural waterslide, respectively; visited to Boon Ko Ku So, a long bamboo bridge stretching across many rice fields; and finally took a quick hike through Pai Canyon, though the gravel floor of the canyon made a scramble of our walk. We finished our day at Two Huts Cafe, where we sampled all three of the popular Thai beer brands as we watched the sun set in front of us.\nI found the entire whirlwind enjoyable, but perhaps my favourite stop was Mor Paeng waterfall. After a short walk from the road and a quick climb up the rock face (there are stairs for the less daring), we found ourselves amidst a series of small waterfalls separated by natural pools and running water. The tourist class was out in spades, and the only Thai I heard came from a group of little kids that occupied themselves by running off of a high rock and falling into the water. Too big to make that jump, I spent my time on the natural waterslide running parallel to the main waterfall. Between the natural calm of the running water and the adrenaline of a controlled slide down the waterfall, I found myself remiss to leave.\nAt a close second (and bearing mention), Two Huts is best known for views of the beautiful Pai sunset over the mountains of Northern Thailand. I and (it seemed) every tourist in Pai trickled in in the hour or two leading up to the event, securing drinks and food despite the ever-growing queues of consumption. (Again, I found myself an unwitting member of a foreign, mostly white, mostly English-speaking tourist class, while every Thai person in sight worked to serve us.) Still, I must recommend anyone in the area make an attempt to see this – it’s beautiful.\n\nWere I to return to Pai, I would spend every night at the night market. I would frequent Mor Paeng, learn to drive a moto, visit the many hikes in the area I was forced to skip, and spend as many evenings as I could manage in front of the sunset. I don’t know if I will return to Pai, nor am I sure I want to. But if I do, I may stay for much longer."

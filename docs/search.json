    "text": "image by Norbert Kowalczyk from Unsplash\n\n1.\n\nWhat are humanity’s great dreams? To conquer the world? To split the atom? When Alexander spread his empire from the Mediterranean to India, we say he conquered the world, but he barely touched a quarter of it. We lie. We lie again when we say we split the atom. ‘Atom’ was supposed to be the smallest piece of matter—all we did is give that name to something we can split, knowing that there are quarks and tensors, other pieces smaller that we cannot touch, and only these deserve the title ‘atom.’ Man is more ambitious than patient. When we realize we cannot split a true atom, cannot conquer the whole Earth, we redefine the terms to fake our victory, check off our boxes and pretend the deed is done. Alexander conquered Earth, we tell ourselves, Rutherford split the atom, no need to try again. Lies.\n\n– Ada Palmer, Too Like the Lightning\n\n\n2.\nMogadishu, the now-capital of Somalia, is a port city on the Indian Ocean. It has been a trade hub for Centuries. When Marco Polo explored the Indian Ocean, it was one of the cities he looked for. He thought he found it, too, and wrote on his map, ‘Madageiscar’ (by way of transliteration). He was wrong and influential and the name spread. Soon, the name ‘Madageiscar’ appeared on maps everywhere atop the island now known as Madagascar.\n\n\n3.\nIt should come as no surprise that humans can split a chair. All we need do is bring a sufficiently large hammer, and we will find the chair in pieces. To split those pieces, we might bring a sharp saw, and to split those pieces, we can use a knife. To split salt, we can dissolve it in water. To split a metal, we can melt it.\nBut each time we split something, we find smaller things. Either, this continues forever, and we find infinitely divisible pieces to our world, or there must be some smallest things – these ‘atoms’ we cannot split. To the Greeks, the former was preposterous and the latter was a matter of course.\nMuch, much later, we found things that we could not split. Sure, we could dissolve salt, but then what about the sodium? We could melt metal, but could not divide the iron. ‘We have found the atom!’ We rejoiced.\nThen, we found the subatomic particles. (We should never have found subatomic particles.) We found the quarks and the tensors and the strange wave-particle duals of quantum physics, and now we write electrons as probability distributions and must ask: ‘Was there ever an atom?’. Perhaps the Greeks were right and infinite divisibility is unthinkable, but perhaps they were wrong too. Perhaps there is a third answer.\n\n\n4.\n‘Homer did not exist’.\nWhat does it mean to say that? Homer is the man who penned the Iliad and the Odyssey. Perhaps the man who penned the Iliad is not also the man who penned the Odyssey. Perhaps a woman first penned both. Perhaps no one person penned either, and they were both assembled by committee.\n\n\n5.\nThat island is Madagascar. The people who live there say so; the United Nations says so; even the Oxford English Dictionary says so. I would be thoroughly outvoted were I to say otherwise.\nAnd yet… ‘Madagascar’ is ‘Mogadishu’ as surely as ‘Anne’ is ‘Anna’. And ‘Mogadishu’ is ancient. So ancient that we do not know where the name comes from (but my favourite theory is that the name means ‘sight killer’). If I, in London, were to start calling the city ‘Bombay’, might we someday have a Bombay in England?\n\n\n6.\nIs that island Madagascar? And if so, is not an atom an atom?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "image from celestegame.com\nCeleste is a video game about achievement, depression, and intrapersonal conflict. In the game, you – Madeleine – climb Mount Celeste. Over the course of seven chapters, you face the challenges presented by yourself and by the mountain, and finally emerge victorious. It’s a beautiful story, deeply emotional and yet, at its core, perfectly simplistic. What sets this story apart, is the way Celeste tells you this story: you are Madeleine, and Madeleine is you.\nI can point to the exact moment I realised I wanted to write about Celeste. There are only really five characters in the entire game: Madeleine; an old woman who lives on the mountain; Mr. Oshiro, the lost spirit of a hotel clerk; Theo, a fellow climber; and a part of Madeleine made physical by Mount Celeste itself (Shadow-Madeleine, if you will). Shadow-Madeleine, the final and perhaps most interesting character, haunts Madeleine. She is, it seems, what Madeleine was running away from when she came to Mount Celeste. When Shadow-Madeleine is first introduced, she chases you across to the end of the level. Indeed, she haunts you in the levels to come. But at the end of the story’s darkest night, that changes – Madeleine decides to stop running away from the negative, goth-girl part of her, and embraces her instead.\nThis moment happens in cutscene. And from the cutscene alone, the moment is powerful, but it is nowhere near as powerful as what follows. After the cutscene, you – as Madeleine – now have to chase Shadow-Madeleine. As you chase her, she pushes you away and throws projectiles your way. The challenge of the game is inverted: you go from trying to avoid Shadow-Madeleine to chasing her. By inverting the level design like this, the game turns its core mechanic (platforming) into a storytelling tool. You, the player, feel Madeleine’s fear of self while running. Then, later, her desperate scramble to catch and accept that part of her is mirrored in your own struggle. What’s more, when you finally do catch Shadow-Madeleine, uniting the two, you are rewarded with an extra ability – your initial one dash is now two dashes. In the most intuitive way possible, the game makes Madeleine twice as powerful, and as soon as you get this power, you move to challenges that would have been impossible without it.\nThis is far from the only time the game’s mechanics tell a story. Madeleine’s anxiety, too, is made tactile. When she has a panic attack, Theo tells her to, ‘focus on your breathing’, while you, the player, are given a mini-game in which you breathe. The mini-game gives you no warning and no tutorial, and learning how to play it on the fly is genuinely panic-inducing. When you do master the new mechanic, Madeleine regains her inner calm. The graphics, music, and movement all reflect that.\nThroughout, the game goes to extraordinary lengths to place the player in Madeleine’s position, and these lengths pay off. I should mention here that Celeste is an exceptionally difficult game – and it’s intended to be. Climbing a mountain is difficult. The developers developed an assist mode – an important decision that makes the game accessible – but they placed a disclaimer on this mode: the game is designed to challenge. This difficulty is part of the fun of the game, but it is also narratively useful. Reaching the top is only so rewarding because the climb was hard."
